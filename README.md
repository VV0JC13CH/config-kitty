# config-kitty
Personal configuration of Kitty

## Install kitty
```
sudo apt install kitty
```
## Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/VV0JC13CH/config-kitty ~/.config/kitty
```
## Bonus
Although the creator of kitty does not approve of this solution, it does a great job for me. Add below line to ~/.bashrc if you spotted errors while using ssh: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/713
```
TERM=xterm-256color
```
